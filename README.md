# CS3640: Intro to Networks and Their Applications

## Assignment 1 - Getting Started with Networking
In this assignment, you will set up and become familiar with the key resources and
tools you’ll use for future assignments: Piazza, Git, Virtual Machines, and the Linux CLI.

## Assigment 2 - Introduction to Socket Programming in Python
In this assignment, you will be introduced to socket programming by building a
simple client-server chat application. This will help you understand core concepts such as socket
creation, data transmission, and handling multiple connections using threading.

## Assignment 3 - Network Simulation and Performance Measurement Using Mininet and iPerf
In this assignment, you will explore the impact of network bottlenecks on different
types of application traffic. You will learn how to use two powerful tools: Mininet and iPerf to
emulate a network and generate traffic patterns within it. Then you will analyze data generated
by these tools to understand the effects of congestion on different traffic patterns (e.g., web
browsing, video streaming, and file transfers). This assignment will help you understand the effects
of congestion on different traffic types and introduce you to fundamental networking concepts
such as throughput, latency, and packet loss.

## Assignment 4 - Building a Basic Network Intelligence and Diagnostic Service
In this assignment, you will: (1) Implement core network diagnostic tools—ping
and traceroute—using ICMP packets to diagnose network connectivity and routing paths. You
will learn how ICMP operates within the network layer of the protocol stack and how it is used to
check the reachability of network hosts and determine the route packets take across networks;
(2) Build a TCP-based network intelligence service that responds to queries regarding domain
information, such as IP addresses, SSL certificates, hosting Autonomous Systems (ASNs), and
organizations. You will gain hands-on experience with network programming in Python, raw
sockets, DNS resolution, SSL/TLS certificates, and WHOIS queries. This assignment will help you
understand ICMP, DNS, SSL/TLS, and WHOIS protocols while giving you practical experience in
building network diagnostic tools and a client-server system.

## Assignment 5 - Scraping and Analyzing Privacy Policies
In this assignment, you will work in groups to complete five key tasks focused on data collection,
analysis, and presentation. The tasks will require you to:
(1) Build a web scraper that collects privacy policies and DNSMPI (Do Not Sell My Personal
Information) links from websites of your choice (at least 100 sites).
(2) Store the scraped data in a structured format (e.g., JSON) with URLs and relevant texts.
(3) Frame and answer research questions based on privacy practices in your collected data.
(4) Write a comprehensive report detailing your methods, analysis, and results, with context
and implications.
Through this assignment, you will learn how to: 
<li>
<ul> • Develop web scraping scripts in Python,</ul>
<ul>• Identify and extract specific information from webpages, </ul>
<ul>• Organize and structure scraped data, and </ul>
<ul>• Design rigorous analysis methods for large datasets. </ul>
<li>
